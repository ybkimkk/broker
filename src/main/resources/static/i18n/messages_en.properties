#metals.module7
metals.module7.1=An Example of  Leveraged CFD Trading
metals.module7.2=Suppose you want to trade CFDs, where the underlying asset is the XAUUSD a Metal,also known as Gold vs US Dollar. Let us suppose that the XAUUSD is trading at:
metals.module7.3=You decide to buy 100 oz of XAUUSD (1Lot of XAUUSD) because you think that the XAUUSD price will rise in the future. Your margin rate is 0.2% (Account Leverage 30:1) . This means that you need to deposit 0.2% of the total position value into your margin account.
metals.module7.4=Now, in the next hour, if the price moves to 1702.36/1702.80, you have a winning trade. You could close your position by selling at the current price of 1702.36 USD.
metals.module7.5=In this case, the price of gold moved in your favor. But, had the price declined instead,moving against your prediction, you could have made a loss. This continuous evaluation of price movements and resultant profit/loss happens daily. Accordingly, it leads to a net return (positive/negative) on your initial margin. In the loss scenario where your free equity,(account balance+ Profit/Loss) falls below the margin requirements (200), the broker will issue a margin call. If you fail to deposit the money, and the market moves further against you,when your free equity reaches the 50% of your initial margin the contract will be closed at the current market price, known as "stop out."

#metals.module8

metals.module8.5=Risk Management:<br/>Advanced trading platforms such as MetaTrader 4 offer excellent risk management tools. Their features include a large range of charting tools but also a multitude of order types and alerts to ensure that you are made aware of any changes to market conditions.
